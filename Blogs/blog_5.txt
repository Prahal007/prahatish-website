My Review: 
\f3\i Court \'96 State vs Nobody
\f0\i0\b0 \
Overall, the movie was good. I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though the pace was slow. Unlike most Indian films, it had very few songs \'97 but that actually made it feel more raw and real. One of the highlights, and perhaps the most powerful moment, was when the doctor\'92s attendant is asked to identify the victim's mother by being shown two different photos. It was shocking, absurd, and perfectly captured the negligence and confusion that mirrors real-life flaws in the Indian legal system.\
The film bravely portrays how difficult it is for people \'97 especially in villages and small towns \'97 to fall in love freely due to caste, status, and societal expectations. It sends a strong message about the importance of knowing one\'92s legal rights. Even children should be made aware of basic laws and protections.\
Mangapathi\'92s role was also worth mentioning \'97 it was a strong, layered character, and Sivaji played it with great conviction. The role perfectly suited him.\
What stood out to me the most was how the film subtly exposed corruption, power dynamics, and the helplessness of those who don\'92t enjoy high-society privilege. It\'92s not just a love story or a courtroom drama \'97 it\'92s a mirror to the very flaws that often obstruct justice in India. I truly believe films like this should be seen widely, especially by the youth, because they spark the kind of important conversations we need today.\
Now I understand why the producer confidently said, \'93I challenge you \'97 if this movie doesn\'92t move you, then don\'92t bother watching my next film, 
\f1\i HIT 3
